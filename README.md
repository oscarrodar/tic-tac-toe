## Terminal Setup (macOS)

For an improved development experience with autosuggestions, syntax highlighting, and git user display:

```bash
chmod +x setup-terminal.sh
./setup-terminal.sh
```

This will install and configure:
- **Starship** - Beautiful prompt with git branch and user display
- **fzf** - Fuzzy finder for command history (Ctrl+R)
- **bat** - Syntax-highlighted file viewer
- **eza** - Modern ls replacement with icons
- **zsh-autosuggestions** - Command suggestions as you type

After running, restart your terminal or run:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```
